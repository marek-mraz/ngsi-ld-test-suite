Documentation       Four brokers are set up A, B, C and D. A has three registrations, one auxiliary for the entities created in B, one inclusive for the entities created in C and one inclusive for the entity created in D.
...                 Check that the entity returned from A match the attributes from the entity in B, C and D.
