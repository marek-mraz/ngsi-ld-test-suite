*** Settings ***
Documentation       Five brokers are set up A, B, C, D and E. A has two registrations, one auxiliary for the entity created in B, one inclusive for the entity created in C. B has two registrations, one redirect for the entity created in D and one redirect for the entity created in E. C shall establish one exclusive registration to E. Check that the entity returned from A match the attributes from the entity in B, C and E.
