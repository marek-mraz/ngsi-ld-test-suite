Documentation       Five brokers are set up A, B, C, D and E. A has two registrations, one auxiliary for the entities created in B and one inclusive for the entity created in C. B has two registration, one redirect for the entities created in D, one redirect for the entity created in E. C has one exclusive registration to E.
...                 The client creates the entity in A. The entity should be present in C and in E with only one attribute. The entity shall not be present in B and E.
