...                 Mandated twice and unconditionally:
...                 - 6.3.2: "\"Length required\" (411) which shall be raised when an HTTP
...                 request provided by a client does not define the \"Content-Length\"
...                 HTTP header."
...                 - 6.3.4: "For HTTP POST, PATCH and PUT HTTP requests implementations
...                 shall check the following preconditions: … Content-Length header shall
...                 include the length of the request payload body" → "\"Content-Length\"
...                 HTTP header absence, shall result in just a 411 HTTP status code
...                 (without any payload body)."
...
...                 No exemption is granted for Transfer-Encoding: chunked, which is how
...                 these cases omit the header (an ordinary requests call always sets it).
...
...                 Antares extension TP — the suite has NO 411 coverage at all, although
...                 its two siblings from the same clause do (415 in 048_01, 406 in
...                 049_01/049_02). That gap is why the requirement went unimplemented.
